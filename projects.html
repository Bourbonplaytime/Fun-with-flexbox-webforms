      <p> Build The Flock is one of my first front end projects and serves as a web hub for a social media networking campaign to facilitate bringing the Louisville athletics community on twitter more in touch with each other. Before I built the site I was doing mass twitter shoutouts regularly to try to get U of L fans to keep up with each other online. The site made it easier for me to try to promote people following each other and helped a lot of people build their social media presence. This will likely always be a work in progress for me but it was a nice way for me to get my feet wet as I was exploring front end design.</p>

      <p>This project reads in a selection of data from Louisville Metro Government on crime within the city into an SQLite database that I created and organized. It then queries that database for custom selection of data which it organizes a plethora of different ways including as a text chart, pie chart, and bar chart. Creating custom visualizations of a data set was a pleasure for me and opened my eyes to a lot of possibilities, creating a curiosity about the further possibilities with Pandas and MatPlotLib as well as what else may be out there to investigate data further.</p>
