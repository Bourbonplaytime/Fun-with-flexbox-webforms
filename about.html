          <h3> I'm a 35 year old developer and lover of all things technical who lives, works and studies in the great city of Louisville, Ky. I take a lot of pride in my status as a Louisvillian and aspire to bring a bit of the culture, hospitality, cuisine, history and general passion this city represents with me everywhere I go. From the Ohio river which brought us all together to our place in bourbon history to our passion for college athletics there's very little about the city I don't love. I do however love to travel, witness and taste the things other cultures have to offer. Whether it be a road trip or a cross country venture to camp, museum hop, or just generally hang out and take in what another community has to offer I'm always trying to sponge up culture from wherever I get the pleasure to be.  </h3>

          <h3> In my free time I enjoy gaming both pc and console and streaming on my twitch.tv channel. I'm also an avid baseball fan specifically the Chicago Cubs though I enjoy great pitching specifically wherever I can find it. I love to patronize MLB ballparks or even MiLB ballparks wherever I'm lucky enough to find them. Sharing thoughts and memories with other baseball fans is one of my favorite things to do. I'm also an avid fan of the Louisville NCAA program in all it's manifestations and am often known to be seen at football, basketball, baseball or soccer games. I play guitar primarily but can play a variety of instruments. I have a background in funk and jazz but also enjoy rock, hip hop, r and b, blues and just about any other musical style I have ever learned anything about. </h3>

          <h3> I've spent a large portion of my professional life behind a bar or serving drinks or food in a parlor or dining room. The service industry will always be a passion of mine and there are few things that express the essence of a place to me more clearly or directly than the food and drink that are distinct to it's people. I've worked in a plethora of atmospheres from prohibition style speakeasies to sports bars to arenas to special event spaces. I thrive on creativity in the creations I concoct behind a bar and I hope to be able to apply this creativity as well as the hospitality skills I have developed to my new life in development. It's a major goal of mine to make my digital and technical libations every bit as unique and delicious as those I have created in my life of hospitality and this drives me everyday.</h3>
