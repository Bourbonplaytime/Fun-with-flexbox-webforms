      <h3>Welcome!</h3>

      <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to sharing the things that I have built with the world.</p>

      <p>I aim to demonstrate a competency with programming projects across the spectrum using a diverse collections of languages and techniques.</p>

      <p>I hope you enjoy perusing through my work as much as I have enjoyed making it. I can't wait to get started in this new industry.</p>

    <div class="column secondary">

      <h3>Ready to go?</h3>

      <p>I hope you're ready to blast off and dig into all the cool stuff I have been building.</p>

      <p>Being able to present this to you is the culmination of about 18 months of study on my part.</p>

      <p>I can't be more excited to have you along for the ride or anxious to get going so let's not waste any time.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="column tertiary">

      <h3>Want to build stuff together?</h3>

      <p>I'm always open to working collaboratively on projects so if you have a cool idea and need help just let me know.</p>

      <p>I'm open to working in a plethora of languages including html, css, js, c#, python, react.js, etc.</p>

      <p>Any interesting project is one I'd be willing to take a look at so don't be shy let's build together.</p>
